## [Simple Counter Design using React JS](https://github.com/saitejapadakandla/CounterApp)

Created a simple Counter App using React JS. Understood the concepts of Virtual DOM and Physical DOM and the communication between them. Used Visual studio code for the project. Got hands on experience on React JS by developing using components using classes and also Stateless Functional Components. Understood React JS well as part of this project.<br/>

**Keywords**: React JS <br/>
**Project Timeline**: Feb 2020<br/>
**Technologies**: React Js<br/>
**IDE**: Visual Studio <br/>



## [Computation of the Capacity of National Aerospace system - Algorithms](https://github.com/saitejapadakandla/saitejapadakandla.github.io/blob/master/files/Report.pdf)
Computed the capacity(maximum number of passengers travelled) between Los Angeles and Newyork city. There are few intermediate airports considered during the process and the time constraint for this problem is one day i.e Jan 6 2020. A Time based graph has been generated with 24 hours in the day as 24 nodes between the cities and at each hour/node the intermediate cities are considered. Then Ford Fulkerson algorithm(Network Flow Algorithm) is applied to compute the Maximum capacity and cut theory is applied to verify the same. Python NetworkX package is used during the process for generating the nodes and computing the max_capacity.<br/>

## [Prediction of Heart disease using various Machine Learning classifier Algorithms](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uCIZWhJf6qlcPRa8XDTeWEXnuZY0Bg3qoG2_NAJ9ogU/edit?usp=sharing)
Problem Description : In today’s modern world, cardiovascular disease is currently one of the leading cause of death across the globe. Diagnosing the patients correctly on timely basis is the most challenging task for medical fraternity. Thus, it’s an implicit necessity to predict the condition at the earliest. The objective of this project is to build classifiers to predict the possibility of predicting whether the person is getting cardiovascular disease
Supervised Learning Algorithms used :
1) Decision Tree (CART - Classification and Regression Trees)
2) Random Forest(Ensemble learning with multitude Decision trees - voting concept)
3) K-nearest neighbor algorithm ( Chose hyper parameter as K= 7 and metric/distance = minkowski) for getting higher accuracy.
4) Naive Bayes.

Dataset : Cleveland Clinical Foundation
UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease 
Results: Got accuracy around 89%  for Decision trees and similar amount for other algorithms as well.

Experiment : Tested on epilepsy data set and got accuracies around >95%.

## [Introduction to Time Frequency Analysis AND Wavelet Transforms](https://github.com/ashmichheda/traverse-media-launcher)
Time-frequency analysis (TFA) is concerned with simultaneous analysis of signals in time-and frequency-domains. A widely encountered topic in signal processing, TFA tools are the standard for the analysis of multiscale systems (e.g., speech processing, seismic data analysis, multiscale filtering, etc.). In this course, I learnt about the basic concepts of time-frequency analysis and three widely established methods, namely, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), Wigner-Ville distributions and wavelet transforms, starting with a review of Fourier transforms. Emphasis was laid on wavelet transforms and their applications. Theoretical concepts are learnt with practical demonstrations in MATLAB at each stage of the course. I used the concepts learnt in this course while publishing the two papers. I have secured place in top 5 performers list in this course.<br/>
