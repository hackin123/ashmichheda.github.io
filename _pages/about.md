If I were to define myself in one word, I'd say Passionate!

I am a first-year Masters student in Computer Engineering(Computer Systems) at [Arizona State University](https://webapp4.asu.edu/programs/t5/majorinfo/ASU00/ESCENCMS/graduate/false). I am currently seeking Summer 2020 Internship Opportunities. <br/>I am a passionate Software Developer diving in the field of Machine Learning. Primarily, my interests lie in Machine Learning, Full-stack software development.

I have 2 years of experience as a Software Developer at [Collins Aerospace](https://www.rockwellcollins.com/) - developing a simulation framework/testing environment for real-time embedded targets for [BOEING](https://www.boeing.com/) client. I've worked on different technologies such as Python, C++, SQL, Linux, Virtualbox,  C#. I have completed my 5years Integrated masters degree in Electronics and Communication Systems from [SASTRA University](https://www.sastra.edu/) in 2017 and then joined as a Student Intern in Collins Aerospace for a period of six months then I got converted to full time.

Apart from work - Sports is an integral part of my life. I play cricket, basketball, football, badminton, and workout sometimes. I enjoy solving puzzles, do some Competitive Programming and Open Source contributions! Please feel free to ping any time, I love to speak with new persons and get to know about their cultures, traditions or can have a technical discussion or a simple chat works too.
