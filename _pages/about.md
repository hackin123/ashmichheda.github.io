If I were to define myself in one word, I'd say Passionate!

I am a first-year Masters student in Computer Engineering (Computer Systems) at Arizona State University (https://webapp4.asu.edu/programs/t5/majorinfo/ASU00/ESCENCMS/graduate/false). I am currently seeking summer 2020 Internship Opportunities.I am a passionate Software Developer diving in the field of Computer Science. Primarily, my interests lie in Full-stack software development and Machine Learning.

I have 3 years of experience as a Software Developer at Collins Aerospace (https://www.rockwellcollins.com/) - developing a simulation framework/testing environment for real-time embedded targets for [BOEING] (https://www.boeing.com/) client. I've worked on different technologies such as Python,C++ 11,HTML,CSS,Bootstrap, Java Script,React JS,JQuery,C#. I have completed my 5years Integrated masterâ€™s degree in Electronics and Communication Systems from SASTRA University(https://www.sastra.edu/) in 2017 and then joined as a Student Intern in Collins Aerospace for a period of six months then I got converted to full time.
I got a chance to work onsite in Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids,Iowa and majorly worked on a python automation tool and qualified it following DO-330 standards.

Apart from work - Sports is an integral part of my life. I play cricket, basketball, football, badminton, and workout sometimes. I enjoy solving puzzles, do Competitive Programming and Open Source contributions! Please feel free to ping any time, I love to speak with new persons and get to know about their cultures, traditions or can have a technical discussion or a simple chat works too.
